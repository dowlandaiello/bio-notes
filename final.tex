Even when accounting for inflation, healthcare spending per capita increased by
nearly 510\% between 1970 and 2018\cite{healthcare_spending}. Furthermore,
according to data published in the Health Affairs journal, the percentage of
household income devoted to healthcare-related expenditures increased to 30\% in
2016\cite{healthaffairs}. Thus, it has become apparent that the matter of
falling coverage rates, as well as rising premiums must be addressed. In doing
so, one might turn to the practice of \textbf{patenting} in the healthcare
sector, specifically in fields presenting a high cost of entry.
Pharmaceuticals, for example, have been notorious for their fiscally-intensive
research and development (R\&D) requirements, and were estimated to incur costs
of around \$2.8 billion in 2013\cite{pharmaceutical_randd_costs}.
